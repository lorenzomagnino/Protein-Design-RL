# Protein Design Environment

The **Protein Design Environment** is a reinforcement learning (RL) environment designed as a toy protein design
environment.

## Environment Description

In this environment, the agent acts by sequentially building a protein sequence.

### Key Features

- **Dynamic Motifs**:
    - A fixed target motif, such as `ARGININE, ISOLEUCINE`, can be used.
    - Alternatively, a random motif of length between 2 and 4 is generated for each episode.
- **Flexible Sequence Lengths**:
    - Sequence lengths can be fixed at 15.
    - The lengths can vary randomly between 15 and 25 for each episode.
- **Reward Structure**:
    - **Motif Rewards**: Bonus for an occurrence of the target motif in the sequence. Smaller bonus added for each amino acids of the target motif is in the sequence.
    - **Charge Penalty**: Penalty if the sequence is not neutral in the end of the episode.

### Environment Mechanics

- **Actions**: The agent chooses an amino acid to append to the sequence.
- **Observation**:
    - The current sequence (padded to a maximum length).
    - The length of the sequence.
    - The target motif (padded to a maximum length).
    - The sequence's charge and the target sequence length.
- **Termination**: An episode ends when the sequence reaches the pre-defined or random length for that episode.

## Goal of the Agent

The agent's goal is to optimize amino acid sequences that:

1. **Design a sequence containing the pattern**: Include an instance of the target motif within the sequence.
2. **Achieve Charge Neutrality**: Ensure the sequence has a net charge of zero to avoid penalties.
